# Timely

Timely is a Python library that makes time series analysis straightforward and accessible. It removes the complexity from initial data exploration, letting you focus on understanding your temporal data rather than preprocessing it.
<!--
## What Makes Timely Different?

When working with time series data, the first steps often involve repetitive tasks like cleaning data, making visualizations, and identifying patterns. Timely handles these tasks efficiently, providing clear insights with minimal setup. Think of it as your first-response toolkit for time series analysis.

For example, this single line of code prepares your time series data for analysis:
```python
clean_series = Timely.preprocess(your_series, freq='h')
```

## Core Features

Timely focuses on three essential aspects of time series analysis:

### Smart Preprocessing
Timely intelligently handles common time series issues:
```python
from timely import TimeSeriesPreprocessor

# Clean and regularize your data
preprocessor = TimeSeriesPreprocessor(freq='h')
clean_series = preprocessor.process(your_series)

# Get a detailed report of what was fixed
print(preprocessor.get_report())
```

### Pattern Discovery
Understand your data at different time scales:
```python
from timely import TimePatternAnalyzer

# Visualize daily, weekly, and monthly patterns
analyzer = TimePatternAnalyzer()
analyzer.analyze_patterns(clean_series)
```

### Time Series Decomposition
Break down your time series into its core components:
```python
from timely import TimeSeriesDecomposer

# Decompose into trend, seasonal, and residual components
decomposer = TimeSeriesDecomposer()
decomposer.decompose(clean_series)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install timely
```

## Real-World Example

Here's a complete example showing how Timely makes time series analysis straightforward:

```python
import timely as ty
import pandas as pd

# Load your time series data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Clean and analyze in just a few lines
preprocessor = ty.TimeSeriesPreprocessor(freq='h')
clean_data = preprocessor.process(data)

# Get instant insights about your data
analyzer = ty.TimePatternAnalyzer()
patterns = analyzer.analyze_patterns(clean_data)

# Understand components of your time series
decomposer = ty.TimeSeriesDecomposer()
components = decomposer.decompose(clean_data)
```

## When to Use Timely

Timely is your go-to tool when you need to:
- Quickly clean and prepare time series data
- Get initial insights about temporal patterns
- Create clear visualizations for time-based data
- Understand basic components of your time series

It's particularly useful for data scientists, analysts, and researchers who need quick, reliable insights from their time series data.
